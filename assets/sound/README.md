# Audio Files Placeholder

The audio files referenced in the application should be placed in this directory:

- `ambient.mp3` - Background ambient sound
- `click.mp3` - Click/interaction sound
- `notification.mp3` - Notification sound

Since these are binary files, you can:
1. Add your own audio files with these names
2. Comment out the audio initialization if you don't need sound
3. Use web-generated sounds instead of file-based audio

The application will continue to work without these files - it will just log warnings in the console.
